This project contains the three aggregation states of liquid crystal, made using Blender.
1-solid state
2-solid->crystalline liquid
3-liquid state

In the folder named 'gif' you can find the animations already converted with .gif extension, and in the 'source' folder you can find the source files from blender.

P.S: to use the files in the 'source' folder you need Blender software.
